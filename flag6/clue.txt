Adam wanted send secret message how ever his lack of knowledge in cryptography made him use alternative method.
He came up with a method which involves two identical files and include the message in one of these files.
Although message seems too obivious to him so he encoded the files using binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation.
He felt it is not enough so he grouped the files and put them inside tarballs over and over.
Finally he felt that message is safe after hiding identity of the tarball.
